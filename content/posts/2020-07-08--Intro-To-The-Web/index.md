I’m sure you’ve been wondering how you can become a web developer in 2020 or create amazing beautiful apps !! I’ve gotcha 😊

When I started coding I didn’t have a smooth list of "what comes after the other type of learning". This Roadmap should guide you to choose a path, learn, and build apps on your own.

### Development in 2020

Before all this, you’ll need some basic programming fundamentals or skills. I’ll personally recommend JavaScript or Python. Now there are a lot of other ones out there you could find, but these are among the easiest and most loved around!

There are 2 main roles or fields of study I’ll talk about in this roadmap.

1. Frontend Developer
2. Backend Developer

## Prerequisite

When i started coding I didnt know anything about these !!( yes Sad😔).But with time, i started writing code with other friends and i understood how they worked. Lol i was late to the party! **Tip**: When you start with HTML/CSS, try to push it to GIT using the CLI. I'll Personally recommend you learn these along your journey.

1. GIT
2. GITHUB
3. CLI or Terminal Commands

These are tools that you'll need if you want to be a developer and share code across other people. Or want to contribute and work with other developers. (Wo b3 hian 😅)

### Frontend Developer

The front end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus and sliders, is a combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being controlled by your computer’s browser.

#### Level 1

To start this journey you’ll need to learn some very basic things. This Includes:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

It might seem like a lot but this is the solid foundation to start anything in this field.

#### Level 2

After you’ll need to choose which framework or library you’ll work with... Some of the common ones are

1. Reactjs
2. Vue Js
3. Angular

There can be a lot of debates and arguments in choosing these libraries or frameworks. But my advice is just to pick the one you think you’ll be most comfortable with. In my view Vue Js (cause it’s easier) or React 😅

### Backend Development

The backend is where you communicate with the database, handle business logic, and send the necessary data to the frontend.

**Would be helpful and advisable if you know HTML, CSS and JavaScript**

#### Level 1

You’ll need to learn a Programming language. My recommendation will be: Python or JavaScript. Others include PHP, Go, Rust, Ruby, .NET etc.

#### Level 2

After learning any of the above, you’ll need to dive into a framework for creating APIs, connecting databases, and handling things like “Are you Registered to my site? If no then you don’t have permission to do this or that”(lol). Based on the language selected, this is my recommendation.

Based on the language selected, this is my recommendation.

1. JavaScript: Node Js
2. Python: Django or Flask
3. Php: Laravel (the latest one)

Now you’ll need to learn a database language to be able to store things you’ll need. There are two types which are NoSql and SQL databases. Both are good, and I think 🤔 you should have a feel of both.😅 Here's my recommendation.

### Recommendation

1. MongoDB: NoSQL Database
2. PostgreSQL: SQL Database

## Summary

This looks interesting I want to learn both.
Yes, it’s fine if you learn both. Combining the Frontend and Backend makes you a Full Stack developer (😎). Its a very long journey but worth it!

Thanks for reading. Hope you find something to choose.

Happy Coding ✌️
